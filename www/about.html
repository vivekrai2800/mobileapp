				<span class="about-theme">What is Tap&Eat </span>	<br/>
					<p>Tap&Eat brings you a mobile solution that aims to revolutionize the services in organized restaurant
					industry by bringing in a novel food ordering and service experience to end customers,
					using cutting edge mobile technology. No Waiting. No Queues. No Hassle for eating and drinking anymore.</p>  
				<span class="about-theme">Making of Tap&Eat </span>	<br/>
					<p>Tap&Eat was born out of the urgency to be served without waiting, the hunger and need to eat and the craving for a quick drink without queuing up!
					 While I was juggling between work and college at LBS and AGSM, I was always looking out for quick bite and chilled beer at the snap of my finger. But I was wise enough to know that there are no genie's around to make my wish come true! (Sorry, the snap of fingers idea didn't work that well with the phones but the tap did!) 
					I had to say enough is enough. In April 2014, I decided to put an end to this hassle and teamed up with my college buddies and ex-flatmates (who are technology rockstars) to build a mobile platform to order and pay from anywhere by avoiding queues and without waiting!</p>
