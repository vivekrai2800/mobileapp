Please understand that any resulting concluded contract/agreement of Goods/Services/receipts involved for an Order is between You and the Operator and not with Us and we are not privy to and/or party to such a contract/agreement. We only have limited authority given to us from our Operators and we only provide limited services as the medium for transactions and conclusion of Orders/contracts between You and our Operators. And hence, we will not be responsible to You for the Order and will not be liable to You in respect of such contracts. </p>
				<p>3.1 Placing an Order through Us constitutes an offer by You to the Operator to enter into a binding contract for the sale of goods set out in the Order. Your relationship with Us remains unaffected and shall be exclusively governed by these Terms of Service.</p>
				<p>3.2 On placing an order with us, we ask You to provide us few mandatory details including/not limited to your contact details like your full name, phone number, email address. You agree to take particular care when providing us with your details and warrant that these details are accurate and complete at the time of ordering. Please read the Privacy Policy Section to understand the terms of usage of your personal data better.</p>
				<p>3.3 For completion of order that requires pre-payment, Mobile payment is required to be made by you. You warrant that the credit or debit card details that you provide are for your own credit or debit card and that you have sufficient funds to make the payment.</p>
				<p>3.4 The User’s Mobile Payment will be authorised and debited in the amount of the Order and the User will be issued with the unique Order number, on placing an order. </p>
				<p>3.5 Once you place an order with us, we also confirm the same by sending a confirmatory email receipt of your order, on behalf of the relevant Operator on the email address provided by you at time of placing order.</p>
				<p>3.6 Tap&Eat or the Operator’s staffs within the respective Venue is free to accept or reject Your Order in case of unavailability of goods or also in its sole and absolute discretion.

A similar notification will also be sent to Your email address and/or Your phone number.</p>
				<p>3.7 On placing any order/using any services offered by us, you represent and warrant to Tap&Eat that you are an adult and above 18 years of age, and are legally capable of entering into a binding contract, and are not violating any applicable laws of the place in which the Operator’s venue is located by placing the Order.

And you are liable to provide proof of your age to the Operator’s staff on placing such orders or otherwise when asked to. You should check that the goods you are ordering is suitable for the intended recipient. In failure of meeting this criterion, the Operator or Tap&Eat is free to reject your order.</p>
				<p>3.9 We will take care, in so far as it is in our power to do so, to keep the details of your order and payment secure, but in case of any security attack/breach outside our control we cannot be held liable for any loss you may suffer if a third party procures unauthorized access to any data you provide when accessing or ordering from our application/website.</p>
				<p>3.10 You will be notified via an in-app “Order Confirmation” message issued by us on behalf of the Operator that the placed Order has been accepted by the Operator and that the goods requested in the Order are being prepared. At this point, the Operator and You have entered a contract of service and You are henceforth unable to cancel or withdraw the Order without the Operator’s permission. </p>
				<p>3.11 Once the Order is ready for collection or delivery, the Operator will notify you the same via an in-app “Order Ready” alert to your Smartphone.</p>
				<p>3.12 Neither Tap&Eat nor the Operator shall be responsible in the event that the User is unable to collect the Order whether by reason of not being permitted entry to the Operator’s Venue, or having to queue to enter the Operator’s Venue or otherwise or unable to receive the Order at his table after having been dismissed from the Venue by the Operator due to his house right. Making an Order shall not entitle the User to enter a Venue or any preferential admission to a Venue. Where there are restrictions (such as, but not limited to, dress code or door policy) on entry into a Venue, the User is strongly advised to only make an Order when he/she is inside the Venue for such venues.</p>

You also warrant that the credit or debit card details that you provide are for your own credit or debit card and that you have sufficient funds to make the payment.</p>
				<p>4.2 All prices listed in the Mobile Application reflect the price the Operator charges at the time of listing and are correct at the time of uploading by the Operator and have been input as received by the Operators and we reserve the right to alter these in the future. The prices for the Goods and Services available to You via the Mobile Application may be different from the prices set out in the menu at the Venue. The prices that apply to Your Order are exclusively those which are displayed via the Mobile Application. </p>
				<p>4.3 We also reserve the right to alter the Goods or Services available for sale on Tap&Eat Mobile application and/or website and to stop listing Operators, Goods or Services.</p>
				<p>4.4 At the time of finalizing your order, and continuing for payment, the total price for the order, goods or services ordered, including delivery charges and other charges, if and when applicable, will be displayed on the Mobile Application when you place your order.

Payment has to be made in cash (If the Operator provides such facility), or by online mobile payment gateway, e.g. credit or debit card,net banking.</p>
				<p>4.5 All Orders that are placed in any other medium than checking in at a restaurant and scanning the QR code, like but not limited to, take away, orders placed prior to visiting the Operator’s Venue, must be paid for by Mobile payment gateway methods only.</p>
				<p>4.6 All Mobile Gateway payments must be paid for at the time of placing an order. Your order shall be placed only once the payment is completed by you. To ensure that shopping online is secure, your debit/credit card details will be encrypted to prevent the possibility of someone being able to read them as they are sent over the internet. Your credit card company may also conduct security checks to confirm it is you placing the order.</p>
				<p>4.7 Tap&Eat uses a Payment Gateway Provider to collect payments from Users on behalf of the Operators. By making any Order through the Mobile Application, the User consents to Tap&Eat’s use of the Payment Gateway Providers' services to collect payments.</p>
			</li>

				<p>5.2 You accept and agree that once the Order is placed, You will not be able to change or cancel the Order and You will not be entitled to a refund for the Order or any part thereof, including in the event that the Operator of the respective Venue exercises its right to refuse to fulfil the Order, as mentioned in Section 3.7. (Comment: Same as 3.7)</p>
				<p>5.3 You also agree to indemnify and hold Tap&Eat harmless in respect of losses which Tap&Eat may incur as a result of any claim for a refund made by You or any third party in respect of any Order that is the subject of a Contract. This does not prevent You from discussing the issue of any refund with the Operator directly and you acknowledge and agree this is outside of the Service provided by Tap&Eat and is solely a matter between You and the Operator.</p>
				<p>5.4 We may cancel a contract on Operator’s behalf, if the goods are not available for any reason. We will notify you with an in-App notification as well as an email, if this is the case and refund any payment that you have made. Please note timelines for such payment refunds depends on the Payment Gateway Provider and your Bank, and is usually but may not be limited to 14 working days.</p>
				<p>5.5 In the unlikely event that the Operator delivers a wrong order or a part of order, you have the right to reject the wrong order and you shall be fully refunded for the unavailable order. If the Operator can only do a partial delivery, in case the full order is not available, after the Order Confirmation is sent and the Contract between You and the Operator is formed, the Operator’s staff should inform you or propose a replacement for unavailable order. You have the right to refuse a partial order at such intimation and get a refund of the unaccepted order. Tap&Eat is not responsible for wrong or partial Orders. The issue has to be settled directly by You with the Operator.</p>
